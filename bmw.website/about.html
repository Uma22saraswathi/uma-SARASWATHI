   <p> The history of the BMW Group reaches back to 1916. Today, the four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce, and BMW Motorrad make the BMW Group one of the world’s leading premium suppliers of automobiles, motorcycles, as well as mobility services. Since the beginning of its history, the company has kept its sight firmly set on the future and has consequently put sustainability and efficient resource management into the centre of its strategy.

 <article><h3> 1916 – ESTABLISHMENT OF BMW.</h3></article>

<p>BMW can trace its roots back to Karl Rapp and Gustav Otto. In 1916, the Flugmaschinenfabrik Gustav Otto company had merged into Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke AG (BFW) at government behest. Elsewhere, in 1917, the Rapp Motorenwerke company became Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, which was duly converted into an AG (public limited company) in 1918. BMW AG subsequently transferred its engine construction operations – including the company and brand names – to BFW in 1922. The date of BFW’s founding, 7 March 1916, has therefore gone down in history as the foundation date of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG.</p>

 <p>After the Second World War, allied soldiers requisitioned and occupied the BMW plants. Since BMW had been classified as an armaments company, machines and tools were dismantled. From 1945 onwards “stopgap” production, mainly of household appliances, was started in Milbertshofen - as was also the case at the Berlin plant.</p>

 <article><h3>1973 – BMW HEADQUARTERS AND BMW MUSEUM.</h3></article>

 <p> Starting in 1970, BMW began building an administrative tower block in the north of Munich. Its unusual shape soon led to it to be known as the "four-cylinder building", and it soon became a notable landmark in the city's architecture. The BMW Museum was installed next to it in a bowl-shaped building that is still one of a kind to this day. The new building complex was officially opened on 18 May 1973.</p>

 First unveiled as a concept car in 1997, the new MINI was launched by the BMW Group in 2001 – the first premium vehicle in the small-car segment. MINI’s advanced design combined with the athletic, cheeky character expressed the lifestyle of an entire generation. The MINI Hatch was the first in 2001 – with many more model variants to follow.</p>
